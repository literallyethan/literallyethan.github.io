This is my portfolio website!

Here is where I will post the projects that I am excited to
show off.

Project 1: Minesweeper
    A fun project that I made myself based on the old Microsoft game as a lesson in
    developing games without an engine, and just to excersice
    software development in general. 

    I wanted to limit the game as a CLI experience to challenge myself
    to make a game that looked good and was fun to play in such an environment.
    I learned a lot and want to keep going to see how far I can push the boundary
    of what makes a CLI game.

    One thing I know I could have done better was to make the code for the game
    more modular and reusable. The input module is pretty independent, but the data
    module is a weird amalgamation of game logic and visual display.
    In the future I will work to separate those two functions for other projects.

    CONTROLS:
        [W/A/S/D] for moving the cursor
        [F] to flag the tile the cursor hovers over
        [SPACE] for uncovering the cursor'd tile.
        [CTRL+C] ([CMD+.] for mac) for exiting the game.
