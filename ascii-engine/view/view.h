/*
    The View module (I'm finally making it!)

    The idea of the view module is to have a universal 
    module for games / engines to use to display the game
    as ASCII imagery on a terminal screen.

    Implementation Thoughts:
    - Visualize the board in layers
        - upper layers of ascii board rendered over
          lower layers
        - I dont know how practical this is
          in a terminal environment where the whole
          board is printed over and over
