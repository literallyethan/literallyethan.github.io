#ifndef VIEW_H
#define VIEW_H
// Module for displaying what the user sees

// Problems to be solved:
/*
    - For this to be reusable, we need some standard format of data
      to read from so we can just pass the data to the printer and have it print
    
    - Alternatively, view can be a reusable bank of functions that be used by 
      the game controller module to display the game in a way determined by 
      the controller

      I.E. We bend the game representation around View, or we bend View around the game representation
      for maximum reusability. But which is better?

// For now, focus on first approach and expand from there
